# 42 Piscine Projects

Welcome to my 42 Piscine Projects repository! This repository contains the projects and exercises I completed during the intensive month-long coding bootcamp, known as the "Piscine," at 42 School. 

## About the Piscine

The Piscine (French for "swimming pool") is a rigorous and immersive coding bootcamp designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming and the unique peer-to-peer learning methodology at 42. Over the course of four weeks, participants tackle a variety of challenging projects, often working around the clock to develop their coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Projects Overview
